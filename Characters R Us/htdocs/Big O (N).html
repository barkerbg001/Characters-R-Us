<h1>Big O (N)</h1>

<br><br>

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. The example below also demonstrates how Big O favours the worst-case performance scenario; a matching string could be found during any iteration of the for loop and the function would return early, but Big O notation will always assume the upper limit where the algorithm will perform the maximum number of iterations.

<pre>bool ContainsValue(IList&lt;string&gt; elements, string value)
{
    foreach (var element in elements)
    {
        if (element == value) return true;
    }

    return false;
