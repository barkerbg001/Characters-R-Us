Batman Origins

Young Bruce Wayne had it all: the only son of respected physician Thomas Wayne, he was the sole heir to the Wayne family fortune. But Gotham City is full of tragic stories, and young Bruce’s is one of them. While on their way home from a family outing, the Waynes cut through what would become known as Crime Alley. A petty thief named Joe Chill attempted to rob them and murdered Bruce’s parents before his eyes. Over his parents’ graves, Bruce swore an oath to avenge their deaths, and so began his battle against crime.

Raised and cared for by the Wayne family’s loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce became obsessed with his chosen mission from that night forward. As a young man, he left Gotham and traveled the world, seeking out the best teachers in all the various disciplines his missions would require, from the martial arts to criminology and escapology. By the time he returned home years later, the young heir to the Wayne fortune and business empire was ready to begin.

Bruce was still left with a dilemma. He possessed considerable skills and resources, but lacked a final, vital, element in his war on crime. Gotham’s criminals were not simply going to roll over for one man, no matter how capable. He was brooding on the matter one night in the study of Wayne Manor, when a bat flew in through the window and startled him. It was then that Bruce realized the missing element was fear. “Criminals are a cowardly and superstitious lot,” he reasoned, and so he adopted the costumed identity and cowl of... the Batman!
