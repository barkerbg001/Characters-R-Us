Introducing ... Spider-Man

He swings through the air on merely a thin strand of webbing. He can climb up the side of a building as easily as he can walk down the street. Due to the irradiated bite of a spider, he has the proportionate strength of an arachnid, and can effortlessly lift nearly ten tons. He has an unexplainable precognitive sense of when danger is approaching. His reflexes, agility, and endurance pale the accomplishments of even the most dedicated athlete. He is the amazing Spider-Man.

But although Spider-Man possesses more power than most people could dream of, his alter ego, Peter Parker, is just a regular guy trying to make ends meet. Imbued with a strict moral code and a heightened sense of responsibility, Peter is always trying to do the right thing, no matter the the sacrifice involved.

More than just the sum of his abilities, Spider-Man's strength and longevity come from the man beneath the mask, a man whose ofteh-head mantra dictates his every dicision: "With great power there must also come - great responsibility!"
