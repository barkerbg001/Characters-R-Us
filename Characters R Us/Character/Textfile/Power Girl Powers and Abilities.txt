Power Girl Powers And Abilities

Under the rays of Earth’s yellow sun, Power Girl manifests the same powers as other Kryptonians: superhuman strength, invulnerability, super-speed, greatly enhanced senses (including “X-ray vision” able to see through solid objects) and powerful heat vision able to heat up, ignite, or melt objects. She is similarly vulnerable to the same things as other Kryptonians, including different varieties of kryptonite, magic, and the loss of the solar energy that provides her powers. Power Girl’s powers have developed during her time on Earth, going from being able to leap great distances to truly able to fly, for example.

In her secret identity as Karen Starr, Power Girl is both a capable businesswoman and a skilled computer programmer and technician, something many—seeing only her aggressive public persona—do not know about her.
