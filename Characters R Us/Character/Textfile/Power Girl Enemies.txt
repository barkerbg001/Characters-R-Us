Power Girl Enemies

Kara identifies strongly with multiple incarnations of the JSA (and now the JSA All-Stars) to the point that most of her enemies are actually team enemies. Ultra-Humanite has caused her personal grief, as has Psycho-Pirate. She harbors intensely violent feelings toward Superboy-Prime because her cousin died by his hand.
