Power Girl Kryptonite

Every surviving Kryptonian’s greatest weakness is the radioactive remains of their home planet of Krypton, known as “kryptonite.” It comes in a number of forms. Green kryptonite is by far the most common. Its radiation saps the Strength and powers of Kryptonians, leaving them impaired, disabled, and eventually debilitated in Strength and power effects. Long-term exposure (usually a matter of minutes, less for a large-enough amount) imposes the dying condition and may led to death. Kryptonite radiation has little effect on humans unless they are exposed to it over a long period of time, in which case radiation sickness or cancer can result. As has been shown with Power Girl and Superboy-Prime, this vulnerability is also dependent on the origin of the kryptonite, as only remnants from that person’s own planet Krypton will negatively affect them.
