Power Girl Personality

Kara compensates for her loneliness and the confusion she feels in her unique circumstances by hiding her emotional vulnerabilities behind an aggressive “in-your-face” exterior. She has a no-nonsense attitude tempered with enough charm that her teammates like her, and she keeps an open mind about most things. Despite her ability to see situations from others’ points of view, she is still far more likely to choose a direct, violent solution to a problem than many of her former and current teammates.
