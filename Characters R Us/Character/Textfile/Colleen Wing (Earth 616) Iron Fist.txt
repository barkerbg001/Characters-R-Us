Colleen Wing - Iron Fist

Professor Wing learned from a monk that Iron Fist was arriving from K'un-Lun. He calculated when Iron Fist would come to New York and sent Colleen to meet him. Professor Wing and Colleen befriended Iron Fist, and Colleen acted as his ally in many of his exploits.

Colleen was kidnapped by Master Khan who used Angar the Screamer to brainwash her into killing Iron Fist. When he arrived to free her, she attacked him, but Iron Fist managed to free her from Angar's influence by bridging their minds. She then defeated Angar in a duel, severely injuring him with her sword.

The Daughters of the Dragon frequently teamed up with Iron Fist and Luke Cage, when they formed the Heroes for Hire.
