Carnage - Maximum Carnage

A doctor at the facility, hoping to find a "cure" for his madness, drew blood from Kasady -- unwittingly enabling Kasady to transform into Carnage -- who went on to recruit an army of psychopathic supervillains including Shriek, Demogoblin, Carrion, and Doppelganger to take over New York City. Using Shriek's "psychic channel" powers, he also drove ordinary New Yorkers to attack one another. Carnage and his "family" were ultimately driven back by Spider-Man, Venom and a number of other superheroes and anti-heroes, with Carnage and Shriek being remanded to Ravencroft.
