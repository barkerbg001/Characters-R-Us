Roderigo

Roderigo is a jealous suitor of Desdemona. Young, rich and foolish, he is convinced that if he gives Iago all his money, Iago will help him win Desdemona's hand. He is frustrated by Desdemona's marrying Othello and going off to Cyprus, and is also desperate enough to help Iago kill Cassio when Iago points out that Cassio is another potential rival for Desdemona's affections.
