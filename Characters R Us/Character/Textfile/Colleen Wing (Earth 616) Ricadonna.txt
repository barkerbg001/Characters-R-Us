Colleen Wing - Ricadonna

She continued working with Misty, reforming the Daughters of the Dragon and becoming bail bondsman, lending bail money to apprehended criminals until their cases worked their way through the criminal justice system. When one of the criminals missed their court date, they would hunt them down and bring them to justice. They also hired Otis Johnson to work in the office. They investigated Celia Ricadonna a wealthy New York publishing magnate and crime lord suspected of involvement in the deaths of some of their clients. Criminals Freezer Burn, Humbug, 8-Ball and Whirlwind were hired to steal a microchip containing a computer virus capable of taking down the global economy. She attempted to kill all the criminals involved in the heist. When Colleen confronted Misty, she sliced off her bionic arm. Tony Stark, however, was able to provide an upgraded version. Teaming up with Iron Fist and one of their client Humbug, they found the auction for the microchip, and brought Ricadonna and took her into the authorities.
