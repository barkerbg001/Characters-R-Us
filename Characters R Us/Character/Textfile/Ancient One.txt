Ancient One

Five centuries ago the master sorcerer called the Ancient Onewas a young farmer in the Himalayan village of Kamar-Taj. He studied sorcery with another villager, Kaluu. When Kaluu sought to use his powers for conquest, the youth thwarted him, and henceforth dedicated his life to opposing evil sorcerers. He eventually became Sorcerer Supreme of Earth's dimension.

Though magic greatly extended his life, the Ancient One knew that his death was inevitable and sought to train a successor. He accepted Baron Mordo as a pupil, altough he was aware of Mordo's potential for evil. Then the American surgeon Stephen Strange arrived, hoping that the Ancient One could cure his injured hands. Instead Strange found a new vocation and asked to become the Ancient One's pupil. Under the Ancient One's tutelage, Doctor Strange ultimately became the new sorcerer supreme of the Earth dimension.

Later, to prevent the demon Shuma-Gorath from entering the Earth dimension through his mind, the Ancient One persuaded Strange to shut down the elderly sorcerer's brain. Thus the Ancient One died in mortal form, but his astral form became "one with the universe."
