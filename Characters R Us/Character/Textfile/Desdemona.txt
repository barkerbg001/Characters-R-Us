Desdemona

Desdemona is the daughter of the Venetian senator, Brabanzio. Othello and Desdemona are secretly married before the play begins. While in many ways stereotypically pure and meek, Desdemona is also determined and self-possessed. She is equally capable of defending her marriage, jesting bawdily with Iago and responding with dignity to Othello's incomprehensible jealousy.
