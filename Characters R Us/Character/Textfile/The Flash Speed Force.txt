The Speed Force

The Flashes (including Barry) and a number of other speedsters are empowered by an extradimensional energy known as “the Speed Force.” Not everyone with superhuman speed draws from the Speed Force (Superman, for example, does not), but those empowered by it are the fastest around.

Wally West was the first modern Flash to learn about the Speed Force, although previous speedsters (like Max Mercury) knew about it, and Barry learned of it upon his death, when he passed out of the universe and into the Speed Force.

In fact, Max Mercury later revealed that Barry Allen created the Speed Force when he first became the Flash, generating “an electrical energy that exists in every dimension, every universe, and every era.” Because of the Speed Force’s trans-temporal and extradimensional nature, it has been able to empower speedsters active generations before Barry Allen was even born, and it has been shown to empower speedsters (including future Flashes) for millennia to come.

Exceeding the speed of light causes a speedster to “brush up” against the extradimensional interface between the Speed Force and physical reality, and many simply disappear into the other dimensional realm as a result.
