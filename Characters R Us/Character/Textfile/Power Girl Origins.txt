Power Girl Origins

Kara Zor-L is the last survivor of a Krypton from an alternate reality no longer in existence. When her reality ceased to exist in the terrible Crisis on Infinite Earths, she, Psycho-Pirate, her cousin Kal-L (the Superman of that reality’s Earth), and Kal-L’s wife Lois were the only survivors. Kara assimilated as best she could to the new reality, but the fluctuating nature of her existence and her inability to remember her true origins made that difficult. More than once she hoped she had discovered her ancestry—another survivor of New Earth’s Krypton, or an Atlantean from pre-cataclysmic times—and was devastated to learn she was wrong. She joined the JSA during one of its reformations, instinctively feeling a sense of belonging without realizing it was an echo of her membership in the same team and personal connections with many of its members in her original reality.

Eventually, thanks to the cruel intervention of Psycho- Pirate, Kara discovered her true origins. During recent events she finally reconnected with Kal-L, who was freed from the pocket dimension that had isolated him and others since the end of the original Crisis. She regained her memories of a family life with him and Lois, only to lose him soon after when he died helping his counterpart bring down the rampaging Superboy- Prime.

Kara continued to soldier on with the JSA until a philosophical disagreement in the group led her and others to splinter off into the JSA All-Stars. After the group had a violent parting of the ways with Magog, Kara accepted the mantle of leadership for the All-Stars.
